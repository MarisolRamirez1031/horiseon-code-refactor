# Horiseon Marketing Co. Website 

## Description 

We have been hired by Horiseon Marketing Company to help with their website so that it meets accessibility standards. We will be given and existing code and our job is to refactor it to the best of our ability to ensure the website is more accesible. Aside from helping people
with disabilities to access our website in a more efficient way, we are also helping ourselves because our website will be better understood
by search engines. Refactoring the existing code to meet accessibility standards will help **all** users to navigate, understand and interact with the website improving user experiences. 

Improving the website by using the correct element tags, classes and IDs is important because users can better navigate through the website and the growing business will only bring more traffic to our page.
